# What is `JSX` ?

JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML like code in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
